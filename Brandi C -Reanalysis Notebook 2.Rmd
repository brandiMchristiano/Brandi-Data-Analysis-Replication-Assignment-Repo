# Getting Started 
```{r}
# Read in data from CSV Files
g <- read.csv("genotypes.csv")
head(g)

k <- read.csv("kinship.csv")
head(k)
```

```{r}
# Read in data from R data set

# I somehow have to get my data in to knit it 
load("new_bonds_data.rda")
head(dyads)
head(events)
head(rates)

head(trials)
```

# Descriptive Statistical Analysis

## 41 bats were used in this study
```{r}
# Number of bats 
# Each bat is used as a receiver and an actor therefore either of these would suffice
length(unique(dyads[,2]))
length(unique(dyads[,1]))

```

## Bats were captured from two different sites in Panama : Tole and Las Pavas

### I had to filter by actor becasue the actors were only listed once and were compared to each reciever
```{r}
# Filtering from the dyads data frame, actor population
# Number of bats captured from Tole 
length(unique(dyads[,1][which(dyads$a.pop=="tole")])) 
# 19 bats were captured from Tole
```
```{r}
# Number of bats captured from Las Pavas
length(unique(dyads[,1][which(dyads$a.pop=="las.pavas")])) 
# 8 bats were captured from Las Pavas
```

## The remaining 14 bats were captive born bats 
```{r}
length(unique(dyads[,1][which(dyads$a.pop=="captive-born")]))
```

## There were 1,214 possible new relationships among all the bats
```{r}
length(unique(dyads[,3][which(dyads$new.dyad)])) # filters through the dyads data frame and picks out dyads where the relationship between the two individuals is a new paring (new.dyad=TRUE) (directed dyad)
```
# Possibile grooming rate versus Actual grooming rates
```{r}
# Possible grooming rates
groom.rate1 <- nrow(rates %>%  #filters the rates data frame for any behavior marked as grooming ("g")
  filter(behav=="g"))
groom.rate1
# There 32,928 possible grooming opportunities

# Actual grooming rates
groom.rate2 <- nrow(rates %>% #filters the rates data frame for any behavior marked as grooming ("g") is greater than 0
  filter(behav=="g") %>% 
  filter(rate>0)) 
groom.rate2
# Grooming actually occurred 3,056 times


# Probability of two bats grooming eachother in a trial
groom.rate3 <- groom.rate2/groom.rate1
groom.rate3

```

## There are 17,621 chances for a bat to recieve a donation
```{r}
feed.pos <- nrow(rates %>% filter(behav=="f"))  # behav is in the rates dataset
feed.pos
```
## However, during trial, only 668 bats donated food to another bat
```{r}
feed.act <- nrow(rates %>% filter(behav=="f") %>% filter(rate>0))
feed.act
```
## There is a 3.8% probability that an individual will donate its food to another individual. This is not taking into account any type of relationship or association. 
```{r}
feed.probability <- feed.act/feed.pos
feed.probability

```
